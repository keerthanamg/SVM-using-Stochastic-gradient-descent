2.Estimation of the best value of the regularization constant:
The best value of regularization constant is (le-3) .This value is giving me best validation test accuracy .Then it is also giving me best test set accuracy

4.Estimation of the accuracy of the best classifier:
The accuracy of the best classifier is 0.80

5.Comments/conclusion comparing the results with and without standardization:
All SVM kernel methods are based on distance so it is required to scale variables prior to running final Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
If we donâ€™t scale the data, the level curves (contours) would be narrower and taller which means it would take longer time to converge Accuracy is much lower without standardization
